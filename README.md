# vehicle-allocation-in-NetLogo-using-RL
Constructed an RL framework to train vehicles in the parking lot to learn an allocation strategy. The parking lot model is an agent-based model created in NetLogo.

In the RL framework, the algorithm is DQN. The agent is the system, which allocates parking spaces to each vehicle. The routes to each parking space are fixed.
